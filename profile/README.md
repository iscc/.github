# ISCC Foundation

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the ISCC Foundation! We are dedicated to developing the International Standard Content Code (ISCC), a modern [ISO standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/77899.html) for content identification.

## About ISCC

Digital content is dynamic and continuously evolving. The ISCC addresses the need for a content-dependent identifier for digital media across various formats. Unlike traditional identifiers, ISCCs are generated directly from the digital content using a variety of specialized algorithms. This ensures data integrity, enables content similarity estimates, and supports numerous digital asset management use cases.

The ISCC is unique in that it allows independent generation of ISCCs from the same content by different parties, without implying ownership or requiring central management. This promotes interoperability among different systems and supports applications like content deduplication, integrity verification, versioning, and more.
